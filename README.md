# Pattern Recognition for Petrol Station Malaysia
This is an interesting project to train a model to recognize the Petrol Stations in Malaysia. There are BHP Petrol Station, Petronas Petrol Station and  Shell Petrol Station. All the images are taken from a different angle like front, back and side of the petrol station. The dataset contains a total of 300 images and 100 images for each category. In this experiment, the dataset was split into 60% (180 images) for training data and 40% (120 images) for testing data. In the end, the dataset was train and evaluate by Multilayer Perceptron and K-NN.

# Datasets
The dataset contains a total of 300 images and 100 images for each petrol station. Total of **THREE** categories for the petrol stations. There are BHP Petrol Station, Petronas Petrol Station and  Shell Petrol Station.

# Experiment Methods
- Multilayer Perceptron
- Multilayer Perceptron with PCA features
- K-NN
- K-NN with PCA features
